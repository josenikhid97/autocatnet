# Software for inferring autocatalytic networks as envisioned by Stuart Kaufmann. 

Some of the algorithms that we have implemented are defined in Hordijk and Steel. 

We use the catlynet software developed in Daniel Huson's lab for visualizing autocatalytic networks. Note that catlynet also provides implementations for inferring RAF's and some. Our focus is on high-performance computing and safety. To this end we have built our software using rust. 

Readers interested in the history of ideas in this field are directed to the following article by Wim Hordijk.
